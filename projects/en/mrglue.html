                        Mr Glue stories is an interactive story-telling app. It is a collection of original stories that we will build up over time. Each story can be personalised, and different elements added as you go along. You can add drawings and colour to the illustrations that are already there. You can record the story and add sound effects and music. You can email your creation to a friend or a member of family, for them to look and listen to. Mr Glue is the leader of a lively cast of characters who appear in each story. Their evil cackles and signature tunes help to bring tales to life. Mr Glue Stories provides an activity that is good alone, or as a group. The youngest readers can get stuck in with help, older readers without.
