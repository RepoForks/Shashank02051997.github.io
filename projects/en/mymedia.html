                        With myMedia you can quickly calculate your university weighted average based on the ECTS earned. For each exam you have to enter just the number of ECTS and the result. Once you have entered all the exams you will be able to calculate your weighted average. In addition to the actual calculation you can see the variation in your average depending on your next exam result, you only need to enter the number of ECTS of the latter. This app is different from myLibretto, it was created for a fast computation of your weighted average, so you don't need to be tidy and insert all the exams names, just ECTS and result of the exam, that's it.                    </p>
